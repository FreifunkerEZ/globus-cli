# Documentation

## Building

Building the documentation requires sphinx:

    $ pip install sphinx

Once sphinx is installed (verify with `which sphinx-build`), it can be
built using the Makefile:

    cd docs
    make

This will create html documentation under `docs/_build/html/`.

## Structure

The documentation is structured as follows:

* `conf.py` - sphinx configuration
* `index.rst` - homepage, contains top-level docs and links to other pages
* `Makefile` - simplifies building the documentation in various formats.
   autogenerated by sphinx-quickstart, tweaked to make html the default action
